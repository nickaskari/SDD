works:
- Removing activities with >2500 trackpoint
- counting activities for users without labels
- start time and end time for activites is correct. Also records the correct number of trackpoints.

unsure of: 
- For users with labels, the number of activities is sometimes different from the number of plt files. 
  Its larger than the num plt files, but different from in the mySQL project. 
  Always have a number of actvities that is smaller compared to that in project 1 for labelled users.
